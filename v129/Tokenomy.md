# Tokenomy of $GIVEUP Platform Token

## Overview

- **Name**: GiveUp Platform Token
- **Symbol**: $GIVEUP
- **TGE Price**: total ETH raised / total supply
- **Total Supply**: determined by successor wave 1
- **Initiator**: [bezu0012](https://x.com/bezu0012)

## Key Features

1. **Token Distribution**: Successor wave 1 is a group of contributors who fulfill the requirements set by the Wave 0 (predecessor).

2. **Token Launch**: The project will deliver tokens when it is live and all planned expectations are met, ensuring no one is left behind.

3. **Price Stability**: The project will implement a mechanism similar to a baseline to prevent the token price from falling below a certain threshold.

4. **Emission Schedule**: 
   - No cap on circulation
   - Each wave represents a significant milestone
   - New token supply will be minted for each wave
   - The amount is decided by the next wave successors, satisfying rules set by the two previous predecessors
   - This follows a Fibonacci-like rule of life

5. **Transparent Minting**: Interested parties can clearly see when new tokens will be minted.

## Token Sharing Model

### Wave 0
- Includes the initiator and early community (developers, early investors, VCs)
- Responsible for making the project go live and setting effective collaboration rules

### Wave 1
- Decides the token share for all Wave 0 participants
- Wave 0 participants must PLEASANTLY (or "hoan hỉ" in Vietnamese) accept the amount given by Wave 1 community as long as they have fullfil all requirement of Wave 0 participants and propose an accepted new requirement for successor (Wave 2)
- Wave 1 participants also receive no token but must agree to take all the burden, responsibility from now on.
- Wave 0 must retire and support Wave 1 whatever and whenever the agreement is not break. When any agreement break, this project fail.

### Wave 2
- Decides the token share for all Wave 1 participants
- Wave 1 participants must PLEASANTLY (or "hoan hỉ" in Vietnamese) accept the amount given by Wave 2 community as long as they have fullfil all requirement of Wave 0, Wave 1 participants and propose an accepted new requirement for successor (Wave 3)
- Wave 2 participants also receive no token but must agree to take all the burden, responsibility from now on
- Wave 1 must be retired and support Wave 2 whatever and whenever the agreement is not break. When any agreement break, this project fail.

### Subsequent Waves
- Follow the Fibonacci pattern established in previous waves

## Important Notes

- If any agreement is broken, the project fails
- All participants must "pleasantly" (or "hoan hỉ" in Vietnamese) accept their allocated share
- Each wave must fulfill requirements set by previous waves and propose new requirements for successors

## Calculation

Interested parties can calculate token distribution for Wave n based on the established Fibonacci pattern.
